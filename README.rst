Component Designer is a GUI configuration tool dedicated to create components 
as well as datasources which constitute the XML configuration strings of 
Nexus Data Writer (NXS). The created XML elements can be saved 
in the extended Nexus XML format in Configuration Tango Server or in disk files.

General overview
================

The NXS Component Designer program allows to creates components as well as 
datasources which constitute the XML configuration strings of 
Nexus Data Writer (NXS). The created XML elements can be saved 
in the extended Nexus XML format in Configuration Tango Server or in disk files.
 
Collection Dock Window contains lists of the currently open components 
and datasources. Selecting one of the components or datasources from 
the lists causes opening either Component Window or DataSource Window. 

All the most commonly used menu options are also available on Toolbar. 

The Component Designer (CD) uses a data base to manage components and data sources. The following procedure outlines the steps to create all required components for a particular experiment:

1. Creation of the data sources: data sources being related to Tango1 attributes can be generated by automated procedures. The others have to be created with the CD.
2. Re-use of existing components: if a device is already in use at another beamline the corresponding component can be imported and the local data sources have to be supplied.
3. Creation of new components: if a device is used for the first time, the component has to be created with the CD and the data sources have to be supplied.
4. Storage of the newly created components and data sources.
